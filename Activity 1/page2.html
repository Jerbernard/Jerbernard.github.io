    <p>
      I enrolled into CPSC 349 for many reasons:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Needed an elective units to graduate</li>
      <li>I heard good things about this course</li>
      <li>I genuinely have an interest in Web Development </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is my first time working with Web Development. I always wanted to learn
      how it works and how to program but I never tried to learn for myself. I'm hoping to learn how
      to be proficient and possible pursue a career in Web Development!</p>
